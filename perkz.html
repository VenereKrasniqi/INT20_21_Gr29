            <h1> <b> LEC superstar Perkz officially joins Cloud9</b></h1> <br> <br>
            <b> BY MATT JOHNSON, DECEMBER 2 2021<br> <br> </b>
            C9 did exceptionally well in the f9 did exceptionally well in the first half of Summer Split with a
            nine-game winning streak, <br> but once former coach Bok “Reapered” Han-gyu started experimenting with the
            team’s drafts, <br>the championship team failed to conquer the playoffs, missing their chances to attend
            Worlds 2020. <br>
            As for Perkz, the multi-role player left G2 with a handful of notable accolades. Aside from G2’s known <br>
            accomplishment as finalists during Worlds 2019, Perkz helped the team grab <br> eight total LEC
            championships and MSI 2019.Now part of the C9 organization, Perkz will reunite with former G2 teammate
            Jesper “Zven” Svenningsen as well as <br> meet some of NA’s finest players in Robert “Blaber” Huang and
            Philippe “Vulcan” Laflamme. <br> The mid-laner will also get to share his veteran experience and knowledge
            with rookie top-laner Ibrahim “Fudge” Allami. <br> <br> <br>
            “I want to make NA great — not again, just great,” Perkz said with a smile. <br> “It’s never been great before honestly so let’s start with simple steps.” <br> <br>
