            <h1> <b> Bjergsen retires from League of Legends, becomes TSM head coach</b></h1> <br> <br>
            <b> BY GLORIA BORGER, DECEMBER 2 2021<br> <br> </b>
            Veteran TSM mid laner Søren "Bjergsen" Bjerg will retire and move into the head-coach <br> role for the team ahead of the 2021 season, he announced in a video on Saturday.
            The decision marks the end of the playing career of one of League of <br> Legends Championship Series' longest-tenured players. Bjergsen first <br> joined TSM in late 2013, replacing team founder and owner Andy "Reginald" Dinh in the mid lane. Over the past eight seasons, 
            <br> he led TSM to win LCS championships and won four MVP awards. "When he told me, I considered retiring alongside him for a week," Doublelift <br> said. "Soren is one of the best players and people I've ever played with, the shoes will be tough to fill." <br>
            One of his favorite aspects of playing was helping the team be on the same page and <br> become better together,he felt that coaching would be a good fit for him. With Bjergsen as head coach, <br> TSM will now have to find a replacement for their mid-laner moving into the 2021 season. <br> <br>
